	            	We met at the most romantic spot in Frederick. The #1 date destination in the DMV. We met …at Mirage, Market Street’s one and only run down hookah bar. Erin was there with some friends who she was interning with at the time, and Tym was also there with a friend. The bar was packed, and the only place for Erin and her friends to sit was at Tym’s table. After some expert witty banter, Erin had scored her friends the only empty seats in the place. They knew it was love after they each blew smoke together in the shape of a heart. Just kidding. Their adventurous friendship slowly blossomed into something more and the rest, well, is history.
